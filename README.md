Problem: Predicting House Prices Based on Features
The price of a house is influenced by multiple factors, and by analyzing the relationships between these factors (features) and the price, we can create a model to make accurate price predictions
•  Size: The total square footage or number of floors.
•  Location: The geographical area or neighborhood of the house.
•  Number of rooms: Bedrooms, bathrooms, and other living spaces.
•  Age of the house: How old the property is.

Importance of Regression Analysis in Predictive Modeling
Regression analysis is a key technique in predictive modeling
Regression helps in understanding how the different features (like size, location, and number of rooms) influence the target variable (price).
The ultimate goal of predictive modeling is to make accurate predictions. Regression models, once trained, can be used to predict the price of a house based on its features.
• Linear regression is used when the relationship between the features and the target variable is assumed to be linear (e.g., the price increases steadily as the size of the house increases).
•  Multiple regression allows for modeling relationships where more than one feature is considered simultaneously. This is crucial for house price prediction because many factors, such as size, location, and age of the house, all influence the price together.
In a regression model, the coefficients or weights assigned to each feature can be interpreted to understand the strength and direction of the relationship between features and the target variable. For instance, if the coefficient for "location" is much higher than the coefficient for "size," we might conclude that location has a more significant impact on house prices in the given dataset.
Regression models also allow us to assess the uncertainty in our predictions. By looking at metrics such as R-squared, p-values, and confidence intervals, we can evaluate how well the model fits the data and how reliable its predictions are.
By removing irrelevant features, we can improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
Regression models provide diagnostic tools to evaluate their performance, such as residual plots (plots of the differences between predicted and actual prices). These plots help to check if the model is making systematic errors and whether additional transformations of the data or more sophisticated models are needed.
